# Golgi Cell Network

Biophysically detailed modelling of the Cerebellar Golgi Cell network.

- Code: https://github.com/sanjayankur31/GolgiCellNetwork
- Data: https://gin.g-node.org/ankursinha/GolgiCellNetwork

Note that all the data lives in the `data` folder and is managed by [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) since GitHub does not allow large files.
So, you must have git-annex installed to fetch the data.
All the code lives in the `code` folder and can be obtained from GitHub (or from g-node, which includes both the code and data).
